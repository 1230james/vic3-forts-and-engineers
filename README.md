# Forts & Engineers

For Victoria 3

## Overview

**Forts & Engineers** (FAE) is a mod for [Victoria 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/) that aims to implement a land fortifications mechanic to the game. Somewhat inspired by [Forts! by Reptilian_brain](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2944315567), although I prefer FAE's implementation of the concept.

With FAE, all countries can now build Fortifications, a new building type meant to represent a network of forts and defensive structures in the state. It comes with multiple new production methods, simulating the evolution from old star-shaped bastion forts with cannons mounted on parapets to concrete bunkers and artillery turrets. It also adds a new Combat Engineers specialist company to land armies to counter the imposing challenges of sieging forts.
